Public Water System Integration
======================



### Sources

- This repo mainly uses data from two sites:
  - Public Potable Water Systems FINAL 06-22-2018_0.csv (<https://data.ca.gov/dataset/drinking-water-public-water-system-information>), which provided water system info.
  - Drinking Water Watch Dataset.xlsx, which provides info for well locations, county primarily served



### Uses

- Click a point on map, the map will automatically find out which county that point belongs to, and render all the wells that serve for that county. 
- Click "Disable Updates" to allow free draggle.
- Multiple wells in large scale are represented as clusters. Stronger color indicates greater number. Click on the cluster circle to zoom into that cluster. Wells are represented as water drops, click on the water drop to see table of info about that particular well.
- Full screen control, distance / area measure are available on the upper left side tools.
